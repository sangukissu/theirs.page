  {
    question: "How does AI photo denoising actually work?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes the patterns of noise in your photo and distinguishes between unwanted grain and important image details."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of noise can BringBack remove?",
    answer: "We can remove virtually any type of digital noise: high-ISO grain, color noise, luminance noise, digital artifacts from old cameras, compression artifacts, and low-light noise. Our AI handles both uniform noise patterns and complex, irregular noise with equal effectiveness."
  },
  {
    question: "Will denoising make my photos look plastic or fake?",
    answer: "No! Our AI is specifically designed to maintain natural texture and detail while removing noise. Unlike basic noise reduction tools that can make photos look over-smoothed or artificial, our system preserves skin texture, fabric details, and other important elements."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does photo denoising cost?",
    answer: "We offer 4 high-quality photo denoising cleanups for just $4.99 - no subscription required. This one-time payment gives you professional-grade noise removal in seconds, compared to traditional photo editing services that charge $30-100+ per photo."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean very grainy or noisy photos?",
    answer: "Yes! Our AI excels at removing even heavy noise from challenging photos like high-ISO night shots or old digital camera images. While results depend on the original photo, we can often make severely noisy images look clean and professional."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the denoising process take?",
    answer: "Most photos are processed and cleaned in under 30 seconds. Simply upload your noisy photo and watch the grain disappear in real-time. No waiting hours or days like traditional photo editing services."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe during processing?",
    answer: "Photos are processed securely for the feature you request. Generated media stays in your account until you delete it. We do not use your family photos to train general-purpose AI models. See our Privacy Policy."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the results aren't what I expected?",
    answer: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the denoising results, we'll refund your purchase - no questions asked. We're confident in our AI's ability to clean your photos, but we stand behind every enhancement."
  },
  {
    question: "What does denoising a photo mean?",
    answer: "Denoising removes unwanted grain or noise from photos—especially from low-light or high-ISO images—while preserving fine details."
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI denoising work on BringBack?",
    answer: "BringBack's AI denoising uses advanced deep learning models to differentiate noise from real detail, delivering clean, sharp images quickly via our cloud-based engine."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to denoise before editing?",
    answer: "Yes—denoising first is recommended. Applying noise reduction before adding contrast or sharpening helps avoid amplifying noise."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does denoising take?",
    answer: "Most images are denoised in under a minute, depending on size and resolution. Larger RAW files may take slightly longer."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my uploaded photo secure?",
    answer: "Photos are processed securely. Generated media stays in your account until you delete it from My Media. See our Privacy Policy."
  },
  {
    question: "Does BringBack preserve fine details when denoising?",
    answer: "Yes. Our AI is trained to remove noise while intelligently retaining key details like textures and edges, avoiding oversmoothing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I batch denoise multiple photos?",
    answer: "Yes—with a paid plan, you can upload and denoise multiple photos in a single batch for faster workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "What image formats are supported?",
    answer: "BringBack supports JPEG, PNG, and RAW formats for denoising to accommodate various user needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Will denoising affect image quality?",
    answer: "No—instead of degrading quality, denoising enhances clarity and usability, especially for noisy, underexposed, or high ISO shots."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the web app mobile-friendly?",
    answer: "Yes—you can upload and denoise photos directly from your phone using our responsive web interface."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use BringBack for commercial photos?",
    answer: "Yes—denoised photos can be used for editorial, commercial, or personal projects, with full usage rights included."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I lose color or dynamic range during denoising?",
    answer: "No—our AI preserves color fidelity and dynamic range while effectively reducing noise."
  }
