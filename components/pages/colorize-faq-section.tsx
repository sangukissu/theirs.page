    question: "How does AI photo colorization actually work?",
    answer:
      "Our AI analyzes the grayscale values, textures, and context in your black and white photo to predict realistic colors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the colors historically accurate?",
    answer:
      "Yes! we have built our tool give you accurate historical colors, you can choose the option to preserve or enhance the colors. It recognizes clothing styles, architectural elements, and cultural context to apply colors that would have been authentic to the time period of your photo.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of black and white photos work best?",
    answer:
      "We can colorize virtually any black and white photo: family portraits, wedding photos, military service pictures, childhood photos, historical images, and vintage postcards. The clearer the original image, the better the colorization results, but we can work with photos of varying quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does photo colorization cost?",
    answer:
      "We offer 4 high-quality photo colorizations for just $4.99 - no subscription required. This one-time payment gives you professional-grade colorization in seconds, compared to traditional hand-colorization services that charge $100-500+ per photo.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I control or adjust the colors?",
    answer:
      "Our AI automatically applies the most historically accurate and natural-looking colors. While the current version doesn't offer manual color adjustment, our intelligent colorization is designed to produce realistic results that honor the original photo's character and historical context.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the colorization process take?",
    answer:
      "Most photos are colorized in under 30 seconds. Simply upload your black and white photo and watch it transform into a vibrant color image in real-time. No waiting weeks like traditional hand-colorization services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will colorization damage or change my original photo?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! We work with a copy of your photo, and the original black and white image remains completely unchanged. You'll receive a new colorized version while keeping your original exactly as it was.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my family history safe during processing?",
    answer:
      "Photos are processed securely for the feature you request. Generated media stays in your account until you delete it. We do not use your family photos to train general-purpose AI models. See our Privacy Policy.",
