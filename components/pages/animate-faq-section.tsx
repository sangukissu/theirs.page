      question: "What types of photos work best for animation?",

    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to generate an animated video?",

    },
    {
      question: "What video formats and quality options are available?",
      answer: "We offer videos in 540p, 720p, and 1080p quality. Videos are provided in MP4 format, which is compatible with all modern devices and social media platforms."

      answer: "Each photo animation costs 10 credits. You can purchase credits through our pricing plans (Starter $4.99, Pro $9.99 and Family $21.99) or buy them individually as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the Old Photo Revival template for modern photos?",
      answer: "While the template is optimized for vintage photos, it can be applied to modern photos as well. However, the best results are achieved with older, vintage-style photographs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the maximum file size for uploaded photos?",
      answer: "You can upload images up to 10MB in size. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, and WebP. For best results, we recommend images with at least 1024×1024 pixel resolution."
    },
    {
      question: "Are my photos stored on your servers?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I download the animated videos?",
      answer: "Yes, once generation is complete, you can download your animated videos directly. The download links remain active for 30 days."
