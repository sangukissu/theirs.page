    {
        question: "How does the Nostalgic Hug video generation work?",
        answer: "Our advanced AI analyzes two separate photos—one of you and one of your loved one. It inherently understands the geometry and emotion of a hug, then seamlessly blends the two people into a realistic video where they embrace. It's not just an overlay; it's a completely generated new memory."
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of photos work best?",
        answer: "For the best results, use clear photos where the person is facing forward or slightly to the side. Avoid photos where the face is obscured or very blurry. Full-body or half-body shots work well. You need one photo for each person."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use old or damaged photos?",
        answer: "Yes! However, we highly recommend using our Photo Restoration tool first to repair any damage and sharpen the details. The clearer the input photo, the more realistic and heartwarming the final hug video will be."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this private? Will my photos be shared?",
        answer: "Photos are processed securely for the hug video feature. Generated media stays in your account until you delete it. We do not use your family photos to train general-purpose AI models. See our Privacy Policy. The full flow costs 19 credits; if the provider reports a failed job after start, credits are refunded automatically when the system can detect the failure."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to create a video?",
        answer: "The process is incredibly fast. Once you upload your photos, our AI typically generates the scene and the final video within 2-3 minutes. You can download it immediately afterwards."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don't like the result?",
        answer: "AI video generation is complex, and results can vary based on the input photos. If the result isn't perfect, we recommend trying with different photo angles. We also offer a satisfaction guarantee—if you're having trouble getting a good result, our support team is happy to help."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I share the video on social media?",
        answer: "Absolutely. The video is yours to keep. It's delivered in a standard MP4 format that works perfectly on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, WhatsApp, and more."
