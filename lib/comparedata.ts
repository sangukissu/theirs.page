      { "q": "How much does one restoration cost on BringBack?", "a": "One restoration uses 1 credit. Packs are $4.99/4, $9.99/20, and $21.99/60. Best unit cost is about $0.37 per restore on the Family Pack. Animation is 10 credits; family portrait is 2 credits." },
      { "q": "Is BringBack cheaper than VanceAI?", "a": "It depends on volume and timeline. For occasional family albums, one-time packs without expiry are usually simpler and can be cheaper than months of subscription. For continuous multi-tool work, VanceAI’s higher tiers may win. Run the math on your photo count and calendar." },

      { "q": "Which is better for old photo facial detail?", "a": "For heirloom faces, prioritize identity preservation and side-by-side review over marketing claims.

You then pay for the one you like best.",

Repair Pro currently lists $39.95 for the first month, $40.95 for the first year, and $99.95 lifetime, with higher monthly and annual renewal prices.

      { "q": "What is the difference between EaseUS Fixo and BringBack?", "a": "Fixo and EaseUS Photo Repair can repair corrupted or unopenable files, which BringBack cannot do. EaseUS also has a separate online old-photo restoration tool that overlaps with BringBack on scratches, fading, blur, and colorization." },
      { "q": "How much does EaseUS Repair Pro cost?", "a": "In August 2026, EaseUS lists Repair Pro at $39.95 for the first month with $49.95 renewal, $40.95 for the first year with $69.95 renewal, or $99.95 for a lifetime licence on one desktop device. Verify the checkout for current tax and renewal terms." },
      { "q": "Is EaseUS photo restoration free?", "a": "EaseUS markets free or trial online tools with limits that are not always spelled out on the landing page, and desktop trials often preview without full save. Treat “free” as try-with-limits and read their current checkout. BringBack sells clear one-time credit packs; feature costs are published on our pricing page." },
      { "q": "How much does BringBack cost for an album?", "a": "Restore = 1 credit per photo. Packs: $4.99/4, $9.99/20, $21.99/60 (~$0.37 per restore best unit). Credits never expire." },
      { "q": "Do I need to install software for BringBack?", "a": "No. BringBack is web-based. EaseUS desktop products require installation and licensing per their terms." },
      { "q": "Does BringBack keep my photos?", "a": "Generated media stays in My Media until you delete it. Temporary staging uploads are cleaned when processing finishes. We do not use family photos to train general-purpose AI models. See Privacy Policy." },
      { "q": "Can EaseUS animate restored photos?", "a": "Yes. EaseUS currently publishes an online old-photo animation tool. BringBack also offers animation at 10 credits; compare the available motion styles and output on the same portrait." },
      { "q": "Will BringBack make faces look plastic?", "a": "Over-smoothing is a risk in many enhancers. Always compare to the original and reject identity drift. See our guide on why AI changes faces." },

BringBack AI specializes in deep generative repair for tears and missing corners." },
      { "q": "Why do my old photos look 'crunchy' or weird on UnblurImage?", "a": "This is a common issue when using digital unblurring tools on historical photos. The AI interprets natural vintage film grain as 'blur' and aggressively sharpens it, resulting in harsh, unnatural artifacts. BringBack is trained to respect and preserve authentic historical textures." },

      { q: "How do you make a family portrait in Kinpict vs BringBack?", a: "Both start from individual photos. BringBack emphasizes photoreal studio harmonization, restore-first multi-era prep, and a fixed 2-credit studio portrait cost. Kinpict emphasizes generator create/edit/repair convenience—compare outputs on your faces." },
      { q: "Is Kinpict good for realistic prints?", a: "Kinpict explicitly offers a realistic family-photo style and print-oriented output. As with BringBack, inspect faces, hands, scale, light, and edges at the intended print size before ordering." },
      { q: "Can I mix black and white with color?", a: "Yes on BringBack—restore/colorize vintage sources carefully so they match modern inputs." },
      { q: "Why do AI family portraits look fake?", a: "Mismatched light, missing contact shadows, scale errors, and identity drift. Better sources and photoreal-focused tools reduce—but do not eliminate—the risk." },
      { q: "How much does a BringBack portrait cost?", a: "2 credits per studio family portrait. Packs from $4.99/4 credits to $21.99/60. Credits never expire." },
      { q: "Do you delete my photos automatically after generate?", a: "No. Generated media stays in My Media until you delete it so you can re-download. Temporary staging uploads are cleaned when processing completes. See Privacy Policy." },
      { q: "Is BringBack a subscription?", a: "No." },
      { q: "Can BringBack animate the portrait afterward?", a: "Animate individual clear faces (10 credits). For groups, prioritize a perfect still first." },
      { q: "Does BringBack support pets?", a: "Family projects sometimes include pets depending on the flow and references—check the family portrait product UI for current subject guidance." },
      { q: "Kinpict vs PixReunion vs BringBack?", a: "All three create family portraits from separate photos. Kinpict currently supports one to six sources and a first free preview; PixReunion advertises up to 12 faces and two 4K outputs per portrait run; BringBack uses 2 credits per studio portrait and shares credits with restoration and animation. Compare the same faces in the products that fit your group size." },
      { q: "What sources should I upload?", a: "Front-facing, well-lit, large faces, minimal obstruction—see choose source photos for likeness." },
      { q: "Does Kinpict store uploaded photos and results?", a: "Kinpict’s editor says it does not store photos or use them for AI training, while signed-in users can access saved results in My Records. Its privacy policy says uploaded images may be collected, processed by service providers, and retained as needed to operate the service. Contact Kinpict support for deletion or a project-specific retention answer." },
      { q: "How much does a Kinpict family portrait cost?", a: "Kinpict currently charges 4 credits per paid generation. Its $15.90 pack supports about 30 generations (~$0.53 each), and its $29.90 pack supports about 70 (~$0.43 each). Credits do not expire; verify live prices before buying." }
