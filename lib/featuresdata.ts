      },
      {
        question: "Can I combine color and black & white photos?",
        answer: "Yes. We can merge modern color portraits with vintage black and white photos by converting everything into a consistent monochrome style and matching the tone curve across all subjects.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you merge old family photos with recent pictures?",
        answer: "Yes. This is one of the strongest use cases for a vintage composite. Older family photos can be restored and then blended with newer portraits into a single black and white image.",

      {
        question: "Does the AI fix scratches on old photos before merging them?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is black and white better than full color for composite portraits?",
        answer: "Often, yes. Black and white removes color mismatch between cameras, lighting setups, and time periods, which usually makes separate photos look more naturally unified.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I choose the contrast or vintage look?",
        answer: "Yes. The default style is balanced and classic, but black and white composites can be guided toward softer vintage tones, richer contrast, or a more dramatic fine-art look.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will the resolution be high enough to print and frame?",

      {
        question: "Is this good for memorial or tribute family portraits?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do you handle different film grain textures?",

        question: "Is this a collage maker or a panorama stitcher?",
        answer: "Neither. This joins people from separate photos into one shared scene, so the result looks like a single photograph rather than several images placed next to each other. If you want a side-by-side grid, a panorama, or a photo strip with borders, a standard collage or panorama app is the right tool — this is not that.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I join old photos with recent ones?",
        answer: "Yes, and it is the most common use. A 1950s print and a phone photo taken last week get brought to the same sharpness, grain and colour temperature so they sit together naturally in one portrait.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many photos can I join at once?",
        answer: "Up to eight people, one photo per person. Fewer people generally gives a stronger likeness on each face, so for a large group it is worth reviewing the result carefully.",
      },
      {
        question: "What makes a good source photo?",
        answer: "A clear, front-facing, well-lit face. Sunglasses, heavy shadow across the face, extreme angles, and very low resolution all reduce likeness. The face matters far more than the file size.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will it actually look like the real person?",
        answer: "It reconstructs each face from the photo you provide, so it is an interpretation rather than a photograph. Likeness is usually strong from a clear source and weaker from a damaged or angled one. Always compare against your original before sharing it, particularly for a memorial portrait.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does it cost?",
