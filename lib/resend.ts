Saw you joined BringBack.pro—welcome!

A lot of users get stuck thinking they need a high-res scan to get good results. I wanted to let you know that a simple phone snap works perfectly.

Our AI actually fixes the lighting and sharpens the blur automatically.

Give it a try with a photo you have lying around. If you don't love the result, reply to this email and let me know.

Cheers,

    getBody: `Hi,

It's been a week since you joined BringBack.pro, but I noticed you haven't tried the Pro Plan yet.

I'm trying to understand what holds users back. Is it the pricing? The features?

If you've been on the fence, I created a small discount code to make the decision a little easier for you.

Code: WELCOME10 (10% OFF the Pro and Family Plans)


The Pro Plan unlocks the Reunion Video feature (where you can hug your loved ones) and 20 restorations. I'd love for you to try it.

Upgrade now: ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://bringback.pro'}/dashboard

Best,
Harvansh Chaudhary`,
